# source: Application source code

Source code files that specifically target Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8. This is not necessarily legacy code, therefore the term "legacy" is normally avoided. (This is intentionally separated from other source code because .NET Framework 4.8 projects are difficult to work with using VS Code.)

## Subfolders

### Maintenance

Command-line interfaces that provide tooling and automation for developers and operators. These apps interact with other services, scripts, and local resources.

### Persistence

Libraries that encapsulate reusable logic, types, and domain models — intended for use in other projects rather than being used directly.

### Test

Libraries and applications specifically designed for testing, validation, and benchmarking to ensure code correctness, performance, and integration coverage.

### UI

Frontend user-facing applications and sites rendered in a browser.
