# Location

Location is a component of the Google Integration API.
  
Classes in this folder implement logic to support clients that need geographic information. 

Currently, this component serves the complete list of countries in the world, and the list of 
provinces (or states) in each country.

In future, this component can be enhanced with:

* [Geolocation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/overview) 
* [Maps, Routes, Places, and Environment](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation)
