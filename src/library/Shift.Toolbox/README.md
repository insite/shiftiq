# Shift.Toolbox

The Toolbox library is similar to the Common library, because implements general-purpose functionality with no dependencies on any specific application, organization, or presentation layer:

It targets .NET Standard 2.0 , including .NET (Core) and .NET Framework applications.

Whenever possible, it targets .NET Standard 2.0 for maximum reusability. Otherwise, it targets .NET Core. (It targets .NET Framework 4.8 only if it is not possible to target .NET Standard or .NET Core.)

Dependencies on third-party libraries are permitted, as needed.
