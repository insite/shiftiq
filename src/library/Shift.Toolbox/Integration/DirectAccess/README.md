# InSite.Integration.DirectAccess

This C# library defines a client interface to the Direct Access API, and implements input and output 
classes (i.e., request and response) to use with the API.

By design, this library has no dependencies on external libraries, except those required for 
serialization and deserialization of JSON and XML.
