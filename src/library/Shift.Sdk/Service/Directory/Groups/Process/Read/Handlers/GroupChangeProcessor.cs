    /// A process manager (sometimes called a saga in CQRS) is an independent component that reacts to domain changes in a cross-aggregate, 
    /// eventually consistent manner. Time can be a trigger. Process managers are sometimes purely reactive, and sometimes represent workflows. From 
    /// an implementation perspective, a process manager is a state machine that is driven forward by incoming changes (which may come from many 
    /// aggregates). Some states will have side effects, such as sending commands, talking to external web services, or sending emails.
