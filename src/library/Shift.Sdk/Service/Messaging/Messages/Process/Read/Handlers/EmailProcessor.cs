    /// A process manager (sometimes called a saga in CQRS) is an independent component that reacts to domain events in 
    /// a cross-aggregate, eventually consistent manner. Time can be a trigger. Process managers are sometimes purely 
    /// reactive, and sometimes represent workflows. From an implementation perspective, a process manager is a state 
    /// machine that is driven forward by incoming events (which may come from many aggregates). Some states will have 
    /// side effects, such as sending commands, talking to external web services, or sending emails.
